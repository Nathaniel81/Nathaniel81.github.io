        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>StudyMate was inspired by my personal journey as a learner. Throughout my education, I faced challenges in staying organized and motivated. To address this, I created StudyMate as a part of my portfolio project during my time at Holberton School. It aims to provide a user-friendly and supportive platform for students to enhance their learning experience.</p>
        <p>This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Nathaniel81/StudyMate">GitHub</a>.</p>
